# CSS Grid vs Flexbox: When to Use Which?

CSS Grid and Flexbox are two powerful layout systems in CSS that have revolutionized the way we build web layouts. Understanding their differences, strengths, and best use cases is essential for any modern web developer.

## CSS Grid

CSS Grid is best for two-dimensional layouts, where you need to control both rows and columns. It allows you to create complex grid-based designs with ease.

### Example: Basic Grid Layout

```css
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
gap: 16px;
```

### When to Use Grid
- Page layouts with both rows and columns
- Dashboards
- Image galleries

## Flexbox

Flexbox is ideal for one-dimensional layouts, either a row or a column. It excels at distributing space and aligning items within a container.

### Example: Basic Flexbox Layout

```css
display: flex;
justify-content: space-between;
align-items: center;
```

### When to Use Flexbox
- Navigation bars
- Toolbars
- Aligning items in a single row or column

## Combining Grid and Flexbox

You can combine both for advanced layouts. For example, use Grid for the main structure and Flexbox for components inside grid items.

## Performance Considerations

Both Grid and Flexbox are highly performant, but using the right tool for the job ensures maintainable and efficient code.

## Conclusion

Choose the right tool based on your layout needs. Mastering both will make you a more versatile developer.
